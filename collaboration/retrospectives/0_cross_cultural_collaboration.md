# Retrospective

- **Stop Doing**
  - Leaving tasks or decisions ambiguous — unclear ownership
     slows progress.
  - Assuming updates will be communicated without check-ins —
     this led to misalignment.
  - Over-relying on asynchronous communication when synchronous
     discussions could resolve things faster.

- **Continue Doing**
  - Effective meetings with strong participation and outcomes.
  - Group collaboration; if anything needs adjustment, go for it.

- **Start Doing**
  - More availability to fasten the process in independent tasks.
  - Clear meeting agendas and possibly holding two meetings per
     week to stay aligned.
  - Following up with the progress of each member and reaching out
    as a group. >> regular check-ins.

- **Lesson Learned**
  - The Project Board should reflect the structure and clarity of
     our work. To keep it organized and useful:
    - Link each issue to its corresponding milestone from the start.
    - Use clear naming of issues according to the milestone.
    - Connect issues properly to branches, pull requests, assignees,
       labels, and reviewers.
    - At the end of each milestone:
      - Remove or revise outdated ones.
      - Keep the board clean, readable, and uncluttered.

## Srategy vs Board

### Ahd

- **What Went Well**
  - Our first meeting introductions went smoothly. We all seem to have
    the same interest, and that's amazing!
  - Branch naming and GitHub usage was a blast for all members.

- **What Didn’t Go as Planned**
  - Time management needs refinement.  
    Our two-day buffer for the first milestone didn’t work out
  this time — but that’s okay.
  - More meetings for the next milestone.

- **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**
**Or remove extra steps?**
  - Removed redundant or unclear branches during cleanup to
    make the board more efficient.
  - Added the milestone tag on the issue naming also to make the project
   board clear in terms of milestones.

### Mohamed Saeed

- **What Went Well**
  - Team meetings and deadlines were set appropriately, even though
    I wasn't able to participate fully.
  - Team division of tasks and responsibilites was clear, which helped
    the project move forward.

- **What Didn’t Go as Planned**
  - Communication breakdowns on my end meant I missed important updates,
    decisions, and opportunities to provide input when the team needed it.
  - I failed to proactively communicate early enough for the team to adjust
    expectations or redistribute tasks effectively.

- **Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?**
**Or remove extra steps?**
  - Better personal time management and prioritization strategies to
    balance competing commitments.
