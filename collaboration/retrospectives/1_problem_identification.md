#### What Went Well (Mohamed Saeed)

* Discovering having same interest early on helped us a long way
* Our process went as smoothly as we wanted: from problem domain to questions  
  that we brainstormed and then we went back to choosing a problem statement and
  an actionable research question; We were flexible with our process.

#### What Didn’t Go as Planned (Ahd)

Meeting with all members; there is always someone missing but that's okay—there are
meeting minutes.

**Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy? Or remove extra steps?**

* Added the discussions to document our process
* The process.md to document our process

avoid misunderstandings.
