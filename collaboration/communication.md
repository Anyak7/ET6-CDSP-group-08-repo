## Communication Channels

How often we will get in touch on each channel, and what we will discuss there:

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to set up meeting agendas, ask for help, fix
 bugs, and organize work.
- **Pull Requests**: Use Pull Requests to discuss and review the changes that
 are to be made (code review).
- **Slack/Discord**: Slack will be the main communication channel for
 this project (day-to-day coordination, quick questions, announcements).
- **Video Calls**: Google Meet will be used for synchronous meetings
 according to the agreed schedule.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and  
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help  
based on how long you’ve been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 → 30 min_: Try on your own  
2. _30 → 60 min_: Ask your group for help  
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack, WhatsApp, or GitHub
