## Social Norms

These norms outline how we aim to interact respectfully and effectively as a team:

### 🧠 Building Trust

- Be honest about your limits — trust grows when expectations match reality.
- Communicate challenges early so teammates can support you.
- Show empathy and consideration in different circumstances.

### 💬 Communication and Collaboration

- Use Slack as the primary tool for communication (must be checked regularly).
- Google Meet every Thursday.
- Everyone will proactively reach out when stuck or overwhelmed.
- Tasks are delegated after each meeting and documented.

### 🧭 Respect and Inclusion

- Respect others’ time — notify the team if you can't attend meetings.
- Listen actively, and don't interrupt others during meetings.
- Celebrate small wins to keep up morale.
- Silence can be misread — speak up when you need support.

### 🛠️ Conflict Resolution

- If trust is damaged: talk directly and kindly, resolve issues early.

> These norms are intention-based and may evolve during the project.
