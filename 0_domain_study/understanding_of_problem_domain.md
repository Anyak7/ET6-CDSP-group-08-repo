# A Summary of Our Group's Understanding Of The Problem Domain

## An overview of the problem statement using system's thinking

### **Patterns & Trends**

* Recurring blackouts: Power cuts occur not just once but in multiple waves
as fighting flares up.
* Geographically shifting outages: Different regions lose service as front lines
move or specific plants are targeted.
* Escalating repair delays: Each attack adds to a backlog of damage, so average downtime
lengthens over months.
* Rising reliance on alternatives: Households increasingly depend on kerosene lamps,
car batteries, or small diesel generators.

### Systemic Structures

* Centralized generation model: National grid fed by a handful of large,
vulnerable plants makes the entire system easy to disable.
* Fragile supply chains: Imported transformers, turbines, and fuel must cross
conflict checkpoints, causing chronic shortages.
* Hazards and unsafe conditions make it difficult for repair teams
to carry out their duties effectively.

### Mental Models

* Planners assume power must flow from big plants down to users, rather
than through distributed networks.
* Combatants view utilities as strategic assets and valid military targets.

## Possible Solutions And Interventions

1. **Distributed, modular generation**  
   Deploy community‑scale solar and battery clusters that keep  
   neighborhoods powered even when central plants are taken offline.

2. **Local ownership and maintenance**  
   Create citizen energy committees trained in basic maintenance  
   and equipped to manage micro-grid systems independently.

3. **Protect critical assets through local agreements**  
   Establish “energy safe zones” via negotiated local agreements,  
   supported by community monitors and neutral facilitators.

4. **Integrate energy into humanitarian mandates**  
   Recognize electricity as vital to health, education, and safety,  
   and include energy access in emergency aid planning and funding.

5. **Adapt financial models for conflict**  
   Pre-position spare parts and fund mobile repair teams using  
   flexible, multi‑year resilience-focused financing mechanisms.
