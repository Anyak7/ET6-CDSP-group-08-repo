# **Meeting 06**

**23/06/2025  
12.00 EST - 1.20 EST  
Google Meet  
Attendees: 3**

## Agenda

> [here is an issue](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/issues/49)

### **Topics Discussed:**


## Strategies for the Sources/ Datasets 


### [Renewable Energy Capacity Statistics 2025](https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2025/Mar/IRENA_DAT_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2025.pdf)

- Our focus is on solar energy.   
 _why we chose it as the centerpiece of our analysis_  
 comparing solar to other renewable sources such as hydropower and wind, as well as to alternatives like biofuels and diesel, to demonstrate its relative advantages—particularly in conflict-affected settings.

 **STRATEGY: Compare between renewables (hydro and wind) and non- renewables (diesel )**

### [STAT Compiler - DHS program](https://www.statcompiler.com/en/)

- It provide nationally representative household-level data, including information on household energy consumption and primary sources of electricity. These surveys also capture the growth of off-grid solar adoption over time, with tables showing the percentage of households using each electricity source over the past years

**STRATEGY: Look for household surveys on primary electricity sources and off-grid solar adoption percentages.**

### [UN Comtrade](https://comtradeplus.un.org/TradeFlow?Frequency=A&Flows=M&CommodityCodes=TOTAL&Partners=0&Reporters=all&period=2024&AggregateBy=none&BreakdownMode=plus)

- Contains international trade data that can support your project by helping you track the import and export of solar energy technologies—such as photovoltaic panels, batteries, inverters, and solar lighting systems—into and out of conflict-affected countries.
  
**STRATEGY: We plan to track import/export volumes and values of solar panels and related equipment.**


### [Statistical Review of Energy World Data](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review/resources-and-data-downloads)
- See how much solar power each of our chosen conflict countries has installed each year ( track its deployment).
- See how much electricity they actually generate from solar (this gives US a clue about how well the systems are working, or their capacity utilization).
- Understand the bigger energy picture in those countries, like their total electricity use, and how solar fits in compared to coal, oil, or other sources.

**STRATEGY: Compare the deployment of solar PVs in conflict-affected countries versus stable (non-conflict) countries.**

### Key discussions

**Action Items**  
  _What needs to be done?_

+ **MORE DATA**


### Decision made  

+ **Project Scope**  
> _widdened the scope_ : They represent different types/durations of conflict, data availability and would strengthen the scope.
  + Renewable Energy Theme: _Solar Energy_ and compare between hydro, wind and nonrenewables like diesel
  + Time Period : _between a decade and 15 years_
  + Geographic Regions: Afghanistan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Gaza, South Sudan, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria

### Follow up

#### Deliverables

[] A non-technical explanation of how you chose to model your domain, and possible flaws in this approach, in your README.  (visuals are helpful!)  
[] Documentation for your data set describing where it came from, how it’s structured, possible flaws, and how someone can recreate it. Think broadly: qualitative data is still data!    
[] All of your data collection and cleaning scripts so someone can replicate your final data set given your raw data sources. Includes scripts for separating your data set into training and validation data, if applicable.  
[] A public hosting of your prepared data set. This can be directly in your repository, or a link to i.  
[] A labeled Git tag for this milestone created before the deadline - we will review your deliverables based on the tagged commit.  
[] Complete the milestone survey.  
[] A retrospective for this milestone (group & individual)  

### Other notes

Any refining on will be considered.  
Any major ones will be discussed.  

### Next meeting Agenda

- Discuss Evan's feedback yesterday
- Discuss Merging opportunities
- Deliverables and how we will approach them
- Environmental and Social impact

+ Thursday 28/06/2025
+ 12 EST “appropriate for everyone”
