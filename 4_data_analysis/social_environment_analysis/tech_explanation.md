# Technical explanation

## Introduction

The analysis utilized two datasets: IRENA_OFGStats_mw.cleaned.xlsx for capacity
in Megawatts (MW) and IRENA_OFGStats_thousands.cleaned.xlsx for connections in
thousands of people. Both datasets included a 'Conflict Status' variable
(Conflict/No Conflict) and spanned the years 2000-2025

## Methodology

### Analytical Techniques

#### Descriptive Analysis

Time-series trends were generated by grouping data
by 'Year' and 'Conflict Status' and summing 'Value'. Distributions were
examined using descriptive statistics. Regional deployment and social
impact patterns were analyzed by summing 'Value' across 'Region' and 'Conflict Status'.

#### Statistical Modeling

- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** Used to test for statistically significant
  differences in the mean 'Value' (MW capacity or thousands of people connected)
  between 'Conflict' and 'No Conflict' groups. The formula used was
  `Value ~ C(Q("Conflict Status"))` for MW data and `Value ~ C("Conflict Status")`
  for thousands data.

- **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:** Employed to model the relationship
between 'Value' (dependent variable) and 'Year' (continuous independent variable)
 and 'Conflict Status' (categorical independent variable). The formula used was
`Value ~ Year + C(Q("Conflict Status"))` for MW data and
`Value ~ Year + C("Conflict Status")` for thousands data.
'Conflict Status' was encoded as a categorical variable.

## Key findings

### Environmental Impact (MW Capacity)

- **Trends:** Visual inspection of raw data indicated a general increase in solar
PV capacity over time in both conflict and non-conflict regions, with non-conflict
regions showing a higher overall capacity and steeper growth.

- **ANOVA:** The ANOVA for solar PV capacity by conflict status yielded a p-value
of 0.2498. This indicates no statistically significant difference in mean solar
PV capacity between conflict and non-conflict regions at the 0.05 significance level.

- **Regression:** The OLS regression model for solar PV capacity showed 'Year'
as a statistically significant predictor (p < 0.001), with a positive coefficient
(0.2643), indicating an increase in capacity over time. 'Conflict Status' was
not statistically significant (p = 0.255). The model's R-squared was very low
(0.007), suggesting that 'Year' and 'Conflict Status' explain very little
variance in capacity.

#### Greenhouse Gas Emissions Avoided

To quantify a direct environmental benefit, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
avoided can be estimated by applying a general emission factor for solar PV
(e.g., 50 gCO2eq/kWh) to the deployed solar PV capacity, considering factors
such as capacity factor and operational lifespan. The annual GHG emissions
avoided will vary significantly based on conflict status, with deployments in conflict
zones typically showing lower mitigation impacts compared to non-conflict regions
due to disparities in installed capacity. This highlights a reduced environmental
benefits in conflict-affected areas.

### Social Impact (Thousands of People Connected)

- **Trends:** Visual inspection suggested a higher number of people connected
to solar PV in non-conflict regions and a faster growth rate compared
to conflict areas.

- **ANOVA:** The ANOVA for people connected by conflict status resulted in
a p-value of 0.774529, indicating no statistically significant difference in
the mean number of people connected between conflict and non-conflict regions.

- **Regression:** The OLS regression model for people connected also found 'Year'
to be a statistically significant predictor (p < 0.001), with a positive
coefficient (19.2464), indicating an increase in connections over time.
'Conflict Status' was not statistically significant (p = 0.774).
The R-squared was very low (0.004), implying that these variables
explain minimal variance in connections.

#### Holistic Social Impact: Interpretation of People Connected

The metric of 'People Connected' to solar PV systems serves as a holistic
indicator of social impact, encompassing various benefits beyond mere electricity
provision. These benefits include, but are not limited to, improved health outcomes
(reduced indoor air pollution from traditional fuels), enhanced educational
opportunities (lighting for study), increased safety and security
(illumination of homes and public spaces), and economic empowerment
(support for small businesses, mobile phone charging). The observed disparities
in 'People Connected' between conflict and non-conflict zones directly reflect
differential access to these multifaceted social advantages. The limited reach
of solar PV in conflict-affected areas therefore implies a constrained realization
of these critical social benefits, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

Although our initial observations might make it seem like conflicts directly hinder
solar power development, our deeper statistical suggests that the
relationship is far more complicated than a simple cause-and-effect. Many other
factors are at play, and the way we define and measure conflict significantly
impacts what we can conclude. This means that truly understanding and addressing
the challenges of bringing solar power to conflict-affected communities requires
a much more detailed and nuanced approach, looking beyond simple labels and
considering the complex web of influences.
