# Non technical explanation

## What We Looked At

We wanted to understand how armed conflicts over the last 25 years have affected
solar power systems. We focused on two main things:

- **Environmental Impact:** How much solar power capacity
(like big solar farms or rooftop panels) was installed in areas with
and without conflict and the possibilities in reducing the global
greenhouse gases.

- **Social Impact:** How many people gained access to solar power in these areas.

We used two main sets of data. One showed the total power generated
(in Megawatts, MW), and the other showed the number of people connected
to solar power (in thousands). Both datasets told us if a country was
experiencing conflict or not in a given year.

## What We Found

### Solar Power Capacity (Environmental Side)

When we looked at how much solar power was being installed, we saw that:

- More Solar in Peaceful Areas: Countries without conflict generally
installed much more solar power and saw it grow much faster over the years.

- Slower Growth in Conflict Areas: While solar power still grew in conflict
zones, it was at a much slower pace. This suggests that wars make it
harder to build big solar projects.

- Slower Access to renewable energy: this has tremendous consequences, in
conflict zones, the relying in fossil fuels increase which will eventually lead
to more CO2 emissions.

However, when we did some more advanced statistical tests,
the direct link between simply being in a conflict zone and
the amount of solar power installed wasn't as clear-cut as we might expect.
This means that just saying 'conflict' or 'no conflict' might not be enough
to explain everything, and other things are probably at play.

### People Connected to Solar Power (Social Side)

For how many people got access to solar power, we observed similar patterns:

- More People Connected in Peaceful Areas: Many more people gained access to
solar power in countries not affected by conflict, and this number grew rapidly.

- Slower Access in Conflict Areas: In conflict zones, fewer people got connected
to solar power, and the progress was much slower. This makes sense, as conflicts
disrupt everything, including efforts to bring clean energy to homes.

Again, our statistical tests didn't show a strong, direct link between just having
a conflict and the number of people connected. This suggests that the situation is
more complicated than a simple 'yes' or 'no' to conflict.

## Why It's Not So Simple (Limitations and Flaws)

Our study, like any other, has some limitations that are important to understand:

- **Conflicts is not just too Simple:** Our data just said "Conflict" or "No Conflict."
But conflicts aren't all the same. Some are short and small, others are long and
devastating. This simple label might hide the real, complex ways conflicts affect
things.

- **Many Other Factors:** The amount of solar power a country installs or how many
people get connected depends on many things, not just conflict. Things like
a country's wealth, its government's policies, help from other countries, and
even its geography all play a huge role. Our simple models didn't include all
these other factors, which is why the statistical results weren't as strong
as the visual trends.

- **Big Picture Data:** Our data was for whole countries, year by year.
But conflicts often happen only in certain parts of a country. So,
if a country is big and only a small part is in conflict, the national
data might not show the true local impact.

- **Cause and Effect:** We can see if conflict and solar power go together,
but it's hard to say if one directly causes the other. Maybe places that
are already struggling (and thus have less solar power) are also more
likely to have conflicts.

- **Different Types of Solar:** We grouped many types of solar power together.
A small solar lamp for a home is very different from a large solar mini-grid.
Their impacts and how they are affected by conflict might be different.

- **People social classes:** to truly measure the affect of people wealth, we
need to incorporate more data about poverty rates and economics.

- **Data Challenges:** Even though the data was clean, collecting information
in conflict zones is very difficult. So, there might be some gaps or
inaccuracies in the data itself.

- **Time Delays:** The effects of a conflict might not be seen immediately.
It could take years for the full impact on solar power development to become clear.

## The Green Side: Avoiding Pollution

Solar power isn't just about providing electricity; it's also a superhero in
the fight against climate change. By using solar, we avoid burning dirty fuels
that release greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the air, which warm our planet.
an estimation can be done to show how much pollution was avoided by the
solar power installed.

- **Less Pollution Avoided in Conflict Zones:** while
solar power in conflict areas may help in reducing pollution, the amount will be
much, much smaller compared to peaceful regions. This is simply
because there will be less solar power installed in war-torn places,
also the excessive use of fuel in cars, planes and other military vehicles is extremely
high during conflicts and its usage is uncontrolled. So, conflicts don't just hurt
people; they also slow down our planet's healing process by limiting clean energy.

## What Solar Access Means for People

When we talk about people getting connected to solar power, it’s more than just
having a light bulb. It’s about a whole range of improvements in their lives:

- **Better Health:** No more breathing in smoke from kerosene lamps or wood fires
, leading to fewer lung problems.

- **Brighter Futures for Kids:** Children can study longer and more safely after
dark, boosting their chances at a good education.

- **New Opportunities:** Small businesses can stay open longer,
and people can charge their phones or other devices, helping them earn a living.

- **Safer Communities:** Light at night can make streets and homes feel safer,
especially in areas where security is a concern.

Because fewer people are connected to solar in conflict zones, it means these
vital benefits are also much harder to come by for those living in the toughest
situations. The conflict doesn't just stop the lights from coming on; it holds
back health, education, and economic growth.

## In a Nutshell

> While our initial observations suggest that armed conflicts slow down solar power
development and access, the statistical models show that the relationship is
more complex than a simple direct link. Many other factors are at play, and the
way we define and measure conflict matters a lot. This means that helping
conflict-affected areas get more solar power requires a deep understanding of
their unique situations and addressing many different challenges,
not just the conflict itself.
