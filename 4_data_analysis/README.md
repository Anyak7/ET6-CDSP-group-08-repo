## Analytical Questions

### 1. **What are the trends in solar energy adoption across the conflict cycle—pre-conflict, active conflict, and post-conflict periods—in conflict-affected countries?**

a. **Input dataset**  

- **File**: `../1_datasets/cleaned data\ONG_conflictcountriesonly.xlsx`  
- **Description:** Contains annual solar electricity installed capacity (MW) per the 9 countries only, with corresponding conflict phase classification.

b. **Conflict Phases Defined**

- Pre-conflict
- Active conflict
- Post-conflict  
(Defined manually per country using historical conflict timelines)

c. **Analysis Goals**

- Visualize capacity growth over time.
- Compare growth behavior across the three phases.
- Identify disruptions or accelerations in adoption linked to conflict periods.
