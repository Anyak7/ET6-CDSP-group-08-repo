# Non-Technical Explanation

**What is This Analysis About?**
This study explores how long-term conflicts and economic conditions affect the
 adoption of solar energy in different countries. It uses trade data to see
  which countries import more solar technology and whether conflict or wealth
   plays a bigger role.
**Key Findings**

- Conflict Impact: Countries with continuous conflicts (like Afghanistan) tend to
 adopt less solar energy compared to periodical conflict (  like Ukraine).

- Economic Influence: Wealthier countries (High GDP) generally adopt more solar
 technology, even if they face periodic conflicts.

- Exceptions: Some countries defy trends—like low-GDP nations with high solar   adoption—highlighting
 unique success stories.

**How Was This Done?**
Data Collection: The study used UN trade data, focusing on solar product imports.

Grouping: Countries were split into:

Continuous conflict zones.

Periodically unstable regions.

Conflict-free nations.

Further divided by wealth (High/Medium/Low GDP).

Product Types: Solar imports were categorized (e.g., solar panels, batteries, lamps).

Trends Over Time: Graphs show how solar adoption changes in each group.

**Why Does It Matter?**

Policy Insights: Helps governments and NGOs target solar investments where
 they’re needed most.

Exceptions Highlight Solutions: Identifies countries overcoming barriers,
 offering lessons for others.

Global Energy Transition: Shows how conflict and economy shape renewable energy progress.
