# Technical Explanation

## Overview

The Conflict duration  notebook analyzes the impact of conflict duration on
solar energy adoption across different countries, considering their economic
 status (GDP classification). The analysis uses trade data from the UN Comtrade
  database, focusing on solar-related product imports.

## Key Components

### Data Processing

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a GitHub repository containing
    cleaned UN Comtrade data.
2. **Conflict Grouping**: Countries are categorized into three groups based on
    conflict duration:
   - Continuous Conflict (e.g., Afghanistan, Syria)
   - Periodical Conflict (e.g., Iraq, Ukraine)
   - No Conflict (e.g., Germany, Saudi Arabia)
3. **GDP Integration**: Countries are further classified by GDP status
    (High, Medium, Low) to analyze economic influences.
4. **Product Categorization**: Solar-related products are categorized
    (e.g., PV Modules, Inverters, Solar Lamps).

### Analysis

1. **Trend Comparison**: A line chart compares solar import trends over time
    for each conflict group.
2. **GDP Influence**: Examines how economic status affects solar adoption under
    conflict conditions.
3. **Exceptions**: Identifies countries that deviate from general trends.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation
   and visualization.
- **Data Source**: UN Comtrade clean dataset (Excel format).

### Key Questions Addressed

1. Does prolonged conflict negatively affect solar adoption rates?
2. How does economic status influence solar adoption under conflict?
3. Are there differences in adoption between conflict categories?
4. Which countries stand out as exceptions?
5. Are there correlations between conflict duration, GDP, and solar imports?

## Technical Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is pre-cleaned, focusing on relevant columns
   like country, product description, net weight, value, and conflict year.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend analysis and
   comparison charts.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Likely includes correlation and group comparison
analyses (though code details are not fully shown)
