## Non- Technical Explanation 

Answering the question:  
**"How have armed conflicts over the past 15 years influenced the deployment, capacity utilization, and household consumption of solar photovoltaic systemsâ€”both environmentally and sociallyâ€”in conflict-affected communities?"**

Sub question analysis:   
**What are the trends in solar energy adoption across the conflict cycleâ€”pre-conflict, active conflict, and post-conflict periodsâ€”in conflict-affected countries?**

We analyzed solar energy development in **9 conflict-affected countries** (2000â€“2024) to understand how war impacts renewable energy growth.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Conflict Often *Increases* Solar Adoption

* **Most solar growth happened during active conflict**, not after peace.
* Solar is **quick to deploy, independent**, and useful when main power systems break.
* **Certainty level:** High (Observed in 8 of 9 countries)

#### 2. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine Is a Unique Case

* Built **8,200 MW**, far more than any other country (30x higher).
* Supported by **pro-solar policy, international funding, and industry capacity**.
* **Certainty level:** Very high (Clear and consistent data)

#### 3. Three Patterns Emerged

* **Crisis Builders**: Rapid growth during war (e.g., Yemen, Sudan)
* **Recovery Rebuilders**: Growth after conflict ends (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan)
* **Slow Starters**: Minimal growth at any time (e.g., Libya, Ethiopia)
* **Certainty level:** Moderate (Small sample, but strong patterns)

#### 4. Peace â‰  Solar Growth

* Many countries **stopped or slowed solar development after conflict**, often due to instability or lack of funding.
* **Certainty level:** Medium (Limited post-conflict data)

#### 5.  Large Projects Still Happen During War

* **Grid-connected projects dominate**, not just small-scale systems.
* Solar is treated as **critical infrastructure**, even during war.
* **Certainty level:** High

#### 6. Conflict Can Push Countries Toward Solar

- **During conflict, solar energy use often increases**, especially in **lower-income countries**.
- This happens because:
  - **War damages the main power grid**, making traditional electricity unreliable.
  - **Solar systems are quicker and easier to install**, especially off-grid setups.
  - **Aid groups provide solar solutions** for essential services like **hospitals, shelters, and refugee camps**.
- **After conflict, progress is uneven**:
  - **Wealthier countries** often continue expanding solar.
  - **Poorer countries** may fall behind due to **lack of funding and support**.
- **Takeaway**: Conflict doesnâ€™t always stop progress â€” in some cases, it can **accelerate the shift to solar energy** out of necessity.

### What Could Be Wrong (Sources of Uncertainty)

* **Some missing or delayed data** during chaotic war periods.
* **"Conflict period" definitions** may not fully reflect complex realities.
* **Installed â‰  working** â€” some reported capacity might not be functional.
* **Small dataset** (only 9 countries) limits global generalization.

### Bottom Line

* **Main insight**: War often *accelerates* solar energy growth, not stops it.
* **Big exception**: Ukraine shows how far a country can go with the right policies and support.
* **Next step**: To sustain momentum, countries need **deliberate post-conflict planning**.
