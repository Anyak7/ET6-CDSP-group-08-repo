## Technical Explanation

### What We Studied

- **Main question:** How does solar energy adoption change during different phases of conflict?
- **Data source:** IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) solar capacity database
- **Countries:** 9 conflict-affected nations (Ukraine, Yemen, Sudan, Ethiopia, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan)
- **Time period:** 2000-2024 (varies by country based on when conflicts started/ended)
- **What we measured:** Installed solar photovoltaic capacity in megawatts (MW)

### How We Defined Conflict Phases

We divided each country's timeline into three periods from the past 25 years:

1. **Pre-conflict:** Years before documented conflict began
2. **Active-conflict:** Years during documented conflict periods  
3. **Post-conflict:** Years after conflict ended (where applicable)

**Important limitation:** We used simple before/during/after categories, which don't capture:

- How intense the fighting was
- Whether conflict affected the whole country or just parts
- Periods when fighting decreased but didn't fully stop

This binary approach may misclassify some periods, especially when conflicts had multiple phases or partial territorial control.

## Our Analytical Methods

### 1. Basic Comparisons Across Phases

**What we did:** Calculated average solar capacity for each conflict phase across all countries.

**Why this approach:** Gives us a baseline to see which phase typically has the most solar development.

**What we found:**

- Pre-conflict: 146 MW average
- Active-conflict: 5,724 MW average (but heavily influenced by Ukraine)
- Post-conflict: 136 MW average

**Technical issue:** Ukraine's extreme values (over 8,000 MW) dominated these averages, potentially hiding patterns in other countries.

### 2. Country Pattern Classification

**What we did:** Grouped countries based on how their solar capacity changed across conflict phases.

**Why this approach:** Recognizes that different countries might respond differently to conflict, rather than assuming one universal pattern.

**Categories we created:**

- **Conflict-Fueled Growth:** Rapid expansion during active conflict (4 countries)
- **Recovery-Driven Growth:** Major expansion after conflict ended (3 countries)  
- **Persistent Low Growth:** Minimal development in all phases (2 countries)

**Strength:** Captures diversity in country experiences.  
**Weakness:** Categories somewhat subjective; some countries could fit multiple patterns.

### 3. Ukraine Separate Analysis

**What we did:** Analyzed Ukraine separately from the other 8 countries due to its extreme values.

**Why this was necessary:** Ukraine's solar capacity (8,200 MW) is 30-40 times larger than any other country. Including it in group analysis would hide patterns in the other countries.

**Impact of this decision:**

- With Ukraine: Active-conflict average = 5,724 MW
- Without Ukraine: Active-conflict average = 71 MW

**Technical justification:** Standard practice in statistics to handle extreme outliers that dominate analysis.

### 4. Simple Linear Regression

**What we did:** Built a basic statistical model testing whether conflict periods predict higher solar growth rates.

**Our model:** Solar Growth Rate = Starting Value + (Effect of Conflict Period) + Random Error

**Results:**

- Coefficient: +1,359 MW (positive relationship between conflict and growth)
- Statistical interpretation: Conflict periods associated with higher growth rates

**Major limitations of this approach:**

- **Small sample size:** Only 9 countries limits statistical reliability
- **Missing variables:** We didn't control for other factors that might explain solar growth:
  - Economic conditions (GDP, inflation)
  - Government policies and incentives
  - International aid and development finance
  - Technology costs and availability
  - Quality of existing electricity infrastructure

- **Statistical assumptions:** Likely violated due to extreme differences between countries

### 5. Grid vs. Off-Grid Analysis

**What we did:** Compared large-scale solar farms (connected to main power grids) with small distributed systems (rooftop solar, village systems).

**Why this matters:** Tells us whether countries focus on major infrastructure or emergency backup systems during conflicts.

**Results:** Grid-connected installations averaged 1,600 MW vs. 50 MW for off-grid systems.

**Interpretation:** Even during conflicts, countries prioritize large-scale infrastructure projects, not just emergency installations.

## Our Statistical Results

### Key Numbers (Excluding Ukraine to Show Typical Patterns)

- **Pre-conflict average:** 0.9 MW
- **Active-conflict average:** 42.5 MW  
- **Post-conflict average:** 33.8 MW

### Growth Pattern Analysis

- **Recovery pattern:** 3 out of 6 countries with complete data showed higher post-conflict than conflict capacity
- **Stagnation pattern:** 2 out of 6 countries showed minimal change across phases
- **Data gap pattern:** 1 country (Yemen) had missing post-conflict data

### Timing Analysis

Solar adoption typically began in three waves:

- **Wave 1 (2004-2010):** Sudan, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Ethiopia
- **Wave 2 (2015-2018):** Syria, South Sudan  
- **Wave 3 (2018-2025):** Yemen, Iraq

Most countries showed growth rates exceeding 500% during their rapid expansion periods.

## What We Couldn't Account For

### Missing Variables That Probably Matter

1. **International aid:** Development finance often increases during and after conflicts
2. **Government policies:** Feed-in tariffs, subsidies, and regulations significantly affect solar adoption
3. **Economic conditions:** GDP growth, currency stability, and investment climate
4. **Technology factors:** Solar panel costs, availability, and technical capacity
5. **Infrastructure quality:** Condition of existing electrical grids and distribution systems

### Data Quality Issues

1. **Reporting gaps:** Countries may not accurately report solar installations during chaotic periods
2. **Capacity vs. operation:** We measured installed capacity, not actual electricity generation
3. **Off-grid underreporting:** Small, distributed solar systems are often poorly documented
4. **Definition inconsistencies:** "Solar capacity" may be measured differently across countries

## Alternative Approaches We Could Have Used

### Panel Data Methods

**What this is:** Advanced regression techniques that account for unobserved differences between countries.

**Advantages:** Could control for country-specific factors we can't measure.

**Why we didn't use it:** Too much missing data and limited time variation would make results unreliable.

### Event Study Analysis

**What this is:** Examine solar capacity changes around specific conflict events (war start, major battles, peace agreements).

**Advantages:** More precise identification of conflict impacts with better timing.

**Why we didn't use it:** Would need monthly or quarterly data and detailed conflict event databases.

## How Reliable Are Our Results?

### High Reliability

- Ukraine's exceptional performance compared to other countries
- General pattern of higher solar adoption during conflict periods
- Scale differences between large and small solar installations

### Medium Reliability

- Specific country categorizations (some countries could fit multiple patterns)
- Post-conflict trends (limited data for several countries still in conflict)
- Magnitude of conflict effects (heavily influenced by a few countries)

### Low Reliability

- Causal claims about conflict causing solar growth
- Generalization to other conflict-affected countries not studied
- Long-term sustainability predictions

## Validity Concerns

### Internal Validity (Are our results accurate for the countries we studied?)

**Potential problems:**

- **Selection bias:** We only studied countries with available data, not a random sample
- **Missing variable bias:** Other factors might explain solar growth better than conflict timing
- **Measurement error:** Solar capacity reporting may be inconsistent

### External Validity (Do our results apply elsewhere?)

**Limitations:**

- Small, non-representative sample of conflict-affected countries
- Specific time period (2000-2024) may not capture typical patterns
- Results may not apply to different types of conflicts (civil war vs. international war vs. terrorism)

### Construct Validity (Are we measuring the right things?)

**Issues:**

- Conflict phases are complex and don't fit neat categories
- Installed capacity may not reflect actual solar energy use or grid integration
- "Conflict" encompasses very different situations across countries

## Recommendations for Better Analysis

### If We Had More Resources

1. **Expand the sample:** Include 20-30 more countries with both conflict-affected and stable countries for comparison
2. **Add control variables:** Collect data on economic conditions, policies, aid flows, and technology costs
3. **Improve timing:** Use monthly or quarterly data to better capture rapid changes
4. **Mixed methods:** Combine statistical analysis with detailed case studies of 3-4 countries
5. **Causal design:** Find natural experiments or use instrumental variables for better causal identification

### For Immediate Improvement

1. **Sensitivity analysis:** Test how results change with different conflict period definitions
2. **Robustness checks:** Exclude different outliers to see if patterns hold
3. **Qualitative validation:** Interview energy sector experts from studied countries
4. **Policy analysis:** Map major energy policy changes to capacity growth periods

## Conclusion

Our analysis successfully identified compelling patterns in solar adoption during conflicts, but these findings should be interpreted as suggestive rather than definitive. The positive association between conflict periods and solar capacity growth appears robust to basic checks, but establishing causation requires more sophisticated methods and better data.

The technical approach appropriately handled major analytical challenges (like the Ukraine outlier) while acknowledging significant limitations. Future research should prioritize expanding the sample size, adding control variables, and improving causal identification strategies.

**Bottom line:** Our methods were appropriate given data constraints, but stronger causal claims require more sophisticated approaches and better data quality.
