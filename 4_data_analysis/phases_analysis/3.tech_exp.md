## Technical Explanation

### 

<details>
<summary><strong>What We Studied: </strong></summary>

- **Main question:** How does solar energy adoption change during different phases of conflict?  
- **Data source:** IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) solar capacity database  
- **Countries:** 9 conflict-affected nations (Ukraine, Yemen, Sudan, Ethiopia, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Sudan)  
- **Time period:** 2000-2024 (varies by country based on when conflicts started/ended)  
- **What we measured:** Installed solar photovoltaic capacity in megawatts (MW)

#### How We Defined Conflict Phases

We divided each country's timeline into three periods from the past 25 years:

1. **Pre-conflict:** Years before documented conflict began  
2. **Active-conflict:** Years during documented conflict periods  
3. **Post-conflict:** Years after conflict ended (where applicable)

**Important limitation:** We used simple before/during/after categories, which don't capture:

- How intense the fighting was  
- Whether conflict affected the whole country or just parts  
- Periods when fighting decreased but didn't fully stop

This binary approach may misclassify some periods, especially when conflicts had multiple phases or partial territorial control.

<summary><strong> Our Analytical Methods</strong></summary>

### 1. Basic Comparisons Across Phases

**What we did:** Calculated average solar capacity for each conflict phase across all countries.  
**Why this approach:** Gives us a baseline to see which phase typically has the most solar development.  

**What we found:**

- Pre-conflict: 146 MW average  
- Active-conflict: 5,724 MW average (but heavily influenced by Ukraine)  
- Post-conflict: 136 MW average  

**Technical issue:** Ukraine's extreme values (over 8,000 MW) dominated these averages, potentially hiding patterns in other countries.

### 2. Country Pattern Classification

**What we did:** Grouped countries based on how their solar capacity changed across conflict phases.  
**Why this approach:** Recognizes that different countries might respond differently to conflict.  

**Categories we created:**

- **Conflict-Fueled Growth:** Rapid expansion during active conflict (4 countries)  
- **Recovery-Driven Growth:** Major expansion after conflict ended (3 countries)  
- **Persistent Low Growth:** Minimal development in all phases (2 countries)  

**Strength:** Captures diversity in country experiences.  
**Weakness:** Categories somewhat subjective.

### 3. Ukraine Separate Analysis

**What we did:** Analyzed Ukraine separately due to its extreme values.  
**Why:** Ukraine's solar capacity (8,200 MW) is 30–40× larger than any other country.

**Impact:**

- With Ukraine: Active-conflict average = 5,724 MW  
- Without Ukraine: Active-conflict average = 71 MW  

**Justification:** Standard outlier handling in statistics.

### 4. Simple Linear Regression

**What we did:** Built a basic statistical model:  
**Solar Growth Rate = Starting Value + Conflict Effect + Random Error**

**Results:**

- Coefficient: +1,359 MW  
- Interpretation: Conflict periods linked to higher growth rates  

**Limitations:**

- Small sample size (9 countries)  
- Missing variables: GDP, policy, aid, etc.  
- Likely violated statistical assumptions due to data spread

### 5. Grid vs. Off-Grid Analysis

**What we did:** Compared grid-connected vs. distributed (off-grid) solar systems.  
**Why:** To see if infrastructure or emergency systems were prioritized.

**Findings:**

- Grid-connected average: 1,600 MW  
- Off-grid average: 50 MW  

**Interpretation:** Conflict zones still prioritized large infrastructure projects.

<summary><strong>Our Statistical Results</strong></summary>

### Key Numbers (Excluding Ukraine)

- **Pre-conflict average:** 0.9 MW  
- **Active-conflict average:** 42.5 MW  
- **Post-conflict average:** 33.8 MW  

### Growth Pattern Analysis

- **Recovery:** 3/6 countries showed higher post-conflict growth  
- **Stagnation:** 2/6 showed minimal change  
- **Data gap:** 1 country (Yemen) lacked post-conflict data

### Timing Analysis

Solar adoption occurred in three waves:

- **2004–2010:** Sudan, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Ethiopia  
- **2015–2018:** Syria, South Sudan  
- **2018–2025:** Yemen, Iraq  

Most countries experienced over **500% growth** during expansion phases.

### How Reliable Are Our Results? 

#### High Reliability

- Ukraine’s outlier status  
- General conflict–solar link  
- Grid vs. off-grid scale differences

#### Medium Reliability

- Country classifications  
- Post-conflict results  
- Magnitude of impact estimates

#### Low Reliability

- Causal claims  
- Generalization to other conflicts  
- Long-term trend forecasts

<summary><strong> Recommendations for Better Analysis</strong></summary>

### If We Had More Resources

1. Collect data on aid, policies, tech, and GDP  
2. Use monthly/quarterly timeframes  
3. Combine with detailed case studies  
4. Apply causal inference methods
</details>

### Conclusion

Our analysis identified clear patterns in solar growth during conflict, especially when Ukraine’s influence is controlled for. Conflict appears associated with higher solar investment — but this is suggestive, not definitive.

We handled key analytical challenges well, including Ukraine’s outlier effect, but deeper causal claims need richer data and more sophisticated tools.

**Bottom line:**  
Appropriate methods were used for the available data, but future work should aim for stronger causal frameworks and more comprehensive datasets.
