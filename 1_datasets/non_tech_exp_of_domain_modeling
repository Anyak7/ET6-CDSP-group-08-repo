# Non- Technical Explanation of Domain Modeling

For our *"Solar Energy in Conflict Zones"* project, we kicked things off with **domain modeling**. Think of it as sketching out a simplified map of how *solar power* actually fits into the incredibly messy reality of *conflict*. It's how we begin to visualize the *key players* and *connections* within these highly challenging environments.

We're looking at things like:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/1_datasets/1_datasets/images/1.png" width="650"/></td>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/1_datasets/1_datasets/images/2.png" width="300"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

This model is our *blueprint* for understanding how *conflict*, *urgent humanitarian needs*, and *solar solutions* interact. We're identifying the *landmarks* – such as *bombed-out power grids*, *families forced to flee*, and the *necessity of communication* – and figuring out how *solar energy* fits in as this vital *"survival infrastructure."*

### **From Concept to Data: The Core Ideas & Why It's Hard**

To wrestle this incredibly complex issue into something we can actually analyze *data-wise*, our model focuses on a few **core ideas**:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 70%;">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>"Survival Infrastructure"</strong>: We're looking at <em>solar PV</em> as a <em>fundamental tool for human survival</em> - not just another <em>green tech solution</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict Lifecycle</strong>: We break down solar's role across the <em>pre-conflict, active conflict, and post-conflict phases</em> – because its utility changes drastically through each.</li>
        <li><strong>Three Pillars of Impact</strong>: To get measurable, we're zeroing in on <strong>Deployment Patterns, Capacity Utilization, and Household Consumption</strong>. These are our core measurable areas, directly feeding into our main research question.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top; width: 30%;">
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/1_datasets/1_datasets/images/3.png" width="2000">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Turning this conceptual stuff into actual data means pinning down **measurable entities.** Things like specific conflict events (their intensity, where they happened), details about the solar systems themselves (capacity, installation type), and then using proxies for energy consumption where direct data is elusive

But let’s be real; collecting data in *active conflict zones* presents major challenges:

- **Data Scarcity & Reliability**: Comprehensive, consistent data? *Forget about it.* Ongoing conflict and access issues make it *extremely rare*.
- **Bias & Underreporting**: Available data is often *incomplete*, *selective*, or *heavily biased*.
- **Attribution Challenges**: It’s difficult to *isolate the exact impact of conflict* from other influencing factors.
- **"Dark Data"**: And a ton of vital info, especially about informal energy use, just never gets recorded. It's 'dark data' for a reason.
