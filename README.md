# Project title

Welcome to group 8 repo(><)  

This repository serves as a collaborative space for developing, documenting,
and sharing data-driven solutions. Our goal is to apply data
science techniques—such as data exploration,
preprocessing, modeling, and visualization—to gain insights and
solve real-world problems.  
As the project progresses, this repository will be updated with relevant datasets,
source code, results, and documentation.  

Stay tuned for more updates!
