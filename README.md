**Welcome aboard the CDSP Group 08- Repository!**  
_Displaced. Determined. Data-Driven._

 🌌  Our Quest:
We are a team united by purpose and shaped by displacement,  
 using data science to drive real-world impact.
This project applies techniques like data exploration, modeling,  
 and visualization to explore how renewable energy especially solar  
can bring resilience and hope to conflict-affected communities.

# [System Thinking](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/main/0_domain_study/understanding_of_problem_domain.md)

To ground our data‑driven work in real‑world context, we’ve prepared a detailed
[systems‑thinking overview](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/dc676e15aa9831b8cd7451ce91443bb873376281/0_domain_study/understanding_of_problem_domain.md)
 of the electrical power challenges in
conflict‑affected areas. It covers:

* **Patterns & trends** in how and where outages occur  
* **Underlying structures** that make the grid vulnerable  
* **Mental models** shaping decision‑making on both sides  
* **Potential interventions** from distributed solar
microgrids to local maintenance committees

# [Problem Statement](0_domain_study/understanding_of_problem_domain.md)

> Citizens in conflict-affected countries require a stable source of electricity, yet ongoing clashes and targeted attacks on power infrastructure have severely disrupted their access to reliable power.

# [Actionable + Refined Research Question](0_domain_study/progress.md)

> **How have armed conflicts over the past decade influenced the deployment,
> capacity utilization, and household consumption of solar photovoltaic
> systems—both environmentally and socially—in conflict-affected communities?**
