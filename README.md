# Collaborative Data Science Project (Group 8)

Welcome to group 8 repo(><)  

This repository serves as a collaborative space for developing, documenting,
and sharing data-driven solutions. Our goal is to apply data
science techniques—such as data exploration,
preprocessing, modeling, and visualization—to gain insights and
solve real-world problems.  
As the project progresses, this repository will be updated with relevant datasets,
source code, results, and documentation.  

Stay tuned for more updates!

To ground our data‑driven work in real‑world context, we’ve prepared a detailed
[systems‑thinking overview](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-08-repo/blob/dc676e15aa9831b8cd7451ce91443bb873376281/0_domain_study/understanding_of_problem_domain.md)
 of the electrical power challenges in
conflict‑affected areas. It covers:

* **Patterns & trends** in how and where outages occur  
* **Underlying structures** that make the grid vulnerable  
* **Mental models** shaping decision‑making on both sides  
* **Potential interventions** from distributed solar
microgrids to local maintenance committees

## Problem Statement

> Citizens in conflict-affected countries require a stable source of electricity, yet ongoing clashes and targeted attacks on power infrastructure have severely disrupted their access to reliable power.

## Actionable + Refined Research Question

> **How have armed conflicts over the past decade influenced the deployment,
> capacity utilization, and household consumption of solar photovoltaic
> systems—both environmentally and socially—in conflict-affected communities?**
