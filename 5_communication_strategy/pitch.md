# **Pitch: Solar Energy for Community Resilience in Sudan**

Thank you for the opportunity to present our project.

We are a team of **displaced MIT Emerging Talent students** who have turned our lived experience into a **data-driven mission**.  
Our **data science project**, based on **25 years of data from 17 countries**, has revealed a crucial insight:  

> **Solar energy is not just a green technology — it’s a lifeline for survival in conflict zones.**

---

## **The Problem**
- Our analysis shows that **solar adoption often surges during active conflict**.  
- In Sudan, **awareness of solar exists**, but it’s seen mainly as a solution for **individual homes or small businesses**.  
- **Critical public services** — clinics, schools, water pumps — still rely on **costly, unreliable diesel generators**.  
- **The challenge:** Shift perceptions toward **collective, public-service solar adoption**.

---

## **Our Solution — The “Solar Survival Kit”**
- **Community-led innovation** designed to create **energy independence**.
- **Not just another solar panel project** — a **blueprint for resilience**.
- **Pilot location:** Khartoum, Sudan.

### **Key Features**
- **Partnership:** Work with **Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees** — trusted, elected community leaders.
- **Co-Creation:** Kits designed **with the committees** to meet public service needs.
- **Training & Ownership:** Committees trained to **manage and maintain** the systems.
- **Public Service Focus:** Designed for **clinics, schools, and water pumps**.
- **Bottom-Up Approach:** Leverages **existing community structures** for sustainability.

---

## **Why It’s Innovative**
- **Shifts power — literally and figuratively — to the community.**
- **Builds resilience** in conflict-affected areas.
- **Ensures sustainability** by making communities the owners and managers of their energy systems.

---

## **Our Ask**
We seek a partnership with **UNHCR** that goes **beyond financial support**:

- **Flexible funding** to launch the pilot project.
- **Expertise & Mentoring** in project management and technical implementation.
- **Advocacy & Amplification** to influence humanitarian policy toward **grassroots, refugee-led solutions**.

---

## **The Impact**
By supporting us, you are:
- Funding a **scalable, replicable model** for energy independence.
- Proving that **empowered displaced communities** can build a **more resilient, self-sufficient future**.

> **This is not just a project — it’s a movement for resilience, led by the people who live it every day.**
