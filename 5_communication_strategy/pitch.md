# **Solar Energy for Community Resilience in Sudan**

## Email Draft:  
Subject: Research on Solar Energy in Refugee Context

Dear Grazia Paoleri,

I am writing to you as a researcher with the MIT Emerging Talent program, focused on solar energy adoption in refugee communities. I've been following the European Union's initiatives on green transition and sustainable energy in Uganda, and I'm impressed by the work your team is doing.  

My research, which combines lived experience with data-driven analysis, shows that solar energy is not just an environmental solution but a crucial survival infrastructure during times of conflict.  
We have found that solar adoption often spikes during conflict, as it becomes a tool for community resilience when traditional grids fail.I believe these findings could be relevant to the EUâ€™s humanitarian and development work . And also for the Refugee Led Innovation Fund.

I would be happy to share my full research and pitch deck with you if you are interested.

Sincerely,
....
