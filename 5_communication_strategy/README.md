This strategy is designed to empower **Popular Committees in Sudan** to champion solar energy solutions for their communities.


## **Core Message**
**Solar power is not just about lights—it's about our community's future.**
- *"When the main power is cut, solar energy keeps our clinics running, our water pumps flowing, and our neighborhoods safe."*
- *"This isn't a temporary fix; it's a permanent solution that gives us control over our own essential services."*

## **Narrative: A Story for Our Community**

### **1. Beginning – The Problem We All Face**
- **Challenge:**
  - The official power grid is unreliable and often fails, especially during crises.
  - Diesel is expensive and hard to find; generators are loud and require constant maintenance.
  - This affects clinics, schools, and water supplies.
- **Misconception:**
  - Solar is for single homes or businesses only.
  - Perceived as too expensive or complex for public services.

### **2. Middle – The New Discovery**
- **Evidence:** Successful solar adoption exists in parts of Sudan and elsewhere.
- **Reality:** Small, durable solar systems outperform the central grid, especially during crises.
- **Opportunity:** Replace costly diesel generators with community-owned solar solutions.

### **3. End – The Call to Action**
- **Implication:** Solar is vital infrastructure for resilience and self-sufficiency.
- **Action:** Popular Committees to lead as champions of solar adoption.

## **Specific Actions & Communication Tools for Committees**

### **1. Communication & Awareness Tools**
- **Infographics** (WhatsApp-shareable) showing solar benefits:
  - *Clinic:* Vaccines stay cold, operations continue at night.
  - *Water Pump:* Water flows without costly diesel.
  - *School:* Evening study possible despite outages.
- **Short Videos:** Success stories from other committees/leaders.
- **Case Studies:** One-page documents including:
  - Problem → Solution → Result.

### **2. Guiding Community Meetings & Forums**
- **Meeting Agenda Template** for discussing solar adoption.
- **Decision-Making Framework** with ranking criteria:
  - People served.
  - Service criticality in emergencies.
  - Sunlight availability and installation space.

### **3. Dispelling Misconceptions**
- **Fact Sheets:**
  - *Myth:* Solar is too expensive → **Fact:** Saves money over time.
  - *Myth:* Solar is for the rich → **Fact:** Community investment benefits all.
  - *Myth:* Solar is unreliable → **Fact:** Modern tech works day/night, even on cloudy days.

### **4. Mobilizing Community Action**
- **Contribution Plan Template** for funding, labor, or site provision.
- **Partner Coordination Guide** for working with aid agencies and NGOs.

## **Audience**
### **The Audience: Popular Committees in Sudan**
- Community-led groups that handle essential services in neighborhoods and villages.  
- Function as local governing bodies when the formal government is weak or absent.  
- Crucial for managing **water, electricity, and sanitation**.  
- Serve as the bridge between the community and outside groups such as aid organizations.

### **Their Background & Skills**
- **Diverse but Capable:**  
  - Members are elected from the community with varied backgrounds.  
  - Expected to have a basic understanding of math and statistics to interpret project data and results.  
- **Tech-Savvy:**  
  - Comfortable using smartphones and the internet.  
  - Ideal partners for communication, data sharing, and digital collaboration.

### **Their View on Solar Energy**
- **Awareness but Limited Use:**  
  - Recognize solar as a resilient solution for Sudan's challenges.  
  - Mostly familiar with its application for individual homes or small businesses.  
- **The Barrier:**  
  - Limited adoption for **public services** such as clinics, schools, or water pumps.  
  - Continued reliance on costly, unreliable diesel generators.  
  - Challenge: Shift the perspective toward a **collective, public-service** approach to solar power.
