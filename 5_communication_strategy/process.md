> üü° _**When the Grid Goes Dark, the Sun Keeps the Lights On**_

In conflict-affected areas, reliable energy isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.  
As power grids fail, **solar quietly powers clinics, clean water, lights ‚Äî and hope**.

## Core Message
> _"Solar energy isn‚Äôt just green ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lifeline."_  
> ‚ÄúWhen the grid goes dark, a $10 solar lamp becomes the difference between isolation and connection.‚Äù

In war-torn regions, it powers what matters most: healthcare, safety, and communication.  
Even amidst destruction, **solar adoption surges** ‚Äî proving itself as *critical humanitarian infrastructure*.  
_It demonstrates surprising resilience and critical adaptation._

| **Why This Matters** |
|--------------------------|
| - _Humanitarian aid planning_ must treat energy as a **basic need** ‚Äî not an afterthought.<br>- For _governments_: decentralizing energy through solar isn‚Äôt just climate action ‚Äî **it‚Äôs conflict resilience planning.** |

## Narrative

### **1. Beginning ‚Äì The Problem**  
In conflict zones, energy systems fail. **90% of refugee settlements lack reliable electricity.**  
[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com?font=Poppins&weight=500&size=14&pause=1000&color=D43737&vCenter=true&repeat=false&width=850&height=40&lines=%F0%9F%93%88+Solar+once+offered+hope+%E2%80%94+but+rising+costs+in+conflicted+communities+threaten+its+role+as+*survival+infrastructure*.)](https://git.io/typing-svg)
<details>
<summary><b>Solar energy is often seen as a cost-effective and scalable solution for energy access ‚Äî but in conflict zones, this promise is threatened by a range of economic and systemic challenges: </b></summary>

- **Solar is more expensive in conflict zones**  
  Even though solar is generally affordable worldwide, in areas affected by war or instability, solutions like solar kits can cost up to **57% more**, making them unaffordable for the communities that need them most. A relevant report is the [IEA's World Energy Outlook 2023](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023)

- **People without electricity mostly live in these places**  
  An estimated **64% of people lacking electricity access live in conflict-affected regions**, meaning that high costs disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations. The [World Bank's Energy Overview](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/energy/overview) states that "Eight out of 10 people without electricity today live in remote, fragile, or conflict-affected regions."

- **Investors see conflict zones as risky**  
  Due to **unstable governments**, **weak currencies**, and **political volatility**, investing in renewable energy in these regions is seen as high-risk and expensive. This discourages private sector involvement and leads to limited project implementation as stated in the paper ["The role of political risk in renewable energy investments: a developing country perspective"](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ea05d053748c4836f162eab825d84bb0fa47c2b3)

- **Humanitarian funding is falling short**  
  Traditional **grant-based aid is insufficient** for delivering sustainable solar solutions. Because energy is often categorized as a ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù goal rather than a humanitarian need, it receives **lower priority in emergency funding** ‚Äî despite being essential for survival. The [Humanitarian Energy Outlook 2023](https://www.humanitarianenergy.org/assets/resources/HEO_2023.pdf)
from the Global Platform for Action (GPA) discusses this.

- **Private companies don‚Äôt want to invest**  
  Many businesses avoid refugee or displacement settings, viewing them as **temporary** and **not commercially viable**, which further reduces investment in renewable energy for those communities. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) report ["Blended Finance Solutions for Clean Energy in Humanitarian and Displacement Settings"](https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/reports/blended-finance-solutions-for-clean-energy/blended-finance-solutions-for-clean-energy-in-humanitarian-and-displacement-settings.pdf) explains it.

These interconnected barriers threaten the role of solar energy as a reliable form of survival infrastructure in the very places where it‚Äôs needed most.

### **2. Middle ‚Äì The Discovery**  
Our data tells a surprising story:  
- **Solar adoption surges during conflict** ‚Äî contrary to expectations.
- **Off-grid tech (like lamps & batteries)** becomes more critical than large infrastructure.
- **Humanitarian response often overlooks energy**, despite its role in survival.


### 3. End ‚Äì The Implication  
Solar isn‚Äôt just green tech ‚Äî it‚Äôs **crisis tech**. But to fulfill its promise, it needs support.  

**Call to Action:**  
> Rethink energy aid. Prioritize solar access in fragile settings.
