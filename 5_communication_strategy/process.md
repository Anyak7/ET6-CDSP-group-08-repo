> üü° _**When the Grid Goes Dark, the Sun Keeps the Lights On**_

In conflict-affected areas, reliable energy isn‚Äôt a luxury ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.  
As power grids fail, **solar quietly powers clinics, clean water, lights ‚Äî and hope**.

## Core Message
> _"Solar energy isn‚Äôt just green ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lifeline."_  
> ‚ÄúWhen the grid goes dark, a $10 solar lamp becomes the difference between isolation and connection.‚Äù

In war-torn regions, it powers what matters most: healthcare, safety, and communication.  
Even amidst destruction, **solar adoption surges** ‚Äî proving itself as *critical humanitarian infrastructure*.  
_It demonstrates surprising resilience and critical adaptation._

| **Why This Matters** |
|--------------------------|
| - _Humanitarian aid planning_ must treat energy as a **basic need** ‚Äî not an afterthought.<br>- For _governments_: decentralizing energy through solar isn‚Äôt just climate action ‚Äî **it‚Äôs conflict resilience planning.** |

## Narrative

### **1. Beginning ‚Äì The Problem**  
In conflict zones, energy systems fail. **90% of refugee settlements lack reliable electricity.**

### **2. Middle ‚Äì The Discovery**  
Our data tells a surprising story:  
- **Solar adoption surges during conflict** ‚Äî contrary to expectations.
- **Off-grid tech (like lamps & batteries)** becomes more critical than large infrastructure.
- **Humanitarian response often overlooks energy**, despite its role in survival.


### 3. End ‚Äì The Implication  
Solar isn‚Äôt just green tech ‚Äî it‚Äôs **crisis tech**. But to fulfill its promise, it needs support.  

**Call to Action:**  
> Rethink energy aid. Prioritize solar access in fragile settings.
