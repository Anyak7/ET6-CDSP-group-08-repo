# **Proposal: Solar Energy for Community Resilience in Sudan**

This proposal outlines a plan to **empower Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees in Sudan** to lead the adoption of solar energy as a vital survival infrastructure for their communities.  

We seek **funding and support from the [UNHCR Refugee-led Innovation Fund](https://www.unhcr.org/innovation/refugee-led-innovation-fund/)** to launch a **pilot project in Khartoum, Sudan**.

## **1. Challenge Framing: The Energy Gap in Crisis (15%)**

The **official power grid in Sudan** is unreliable and frequently fails, particularly in conflict-affected areas. This instability forces communities to rely on **expensive, scarce, and high-maintenance diesel generators** for essential services.

While solar energy is recognized as a **resilient solution**, its use has been limited to **individual homes and private businesses**, largely overlooking critical public services like **clinics, schools, and water pumps**.

**Observed Impacts:**
- **Healthcare:** Without consistent power, vaccines spoil and clinics can’t operate after dark.
- **Water Supply:** Pumps stop, forcing residents to fetch water manually.
- **Education:** Evening classes are canceled due to lack of light.

Our team — **deeply rooted in the community** — aims to address this tangible, life-affecting challenge by introducing a **sustainable alternative** to diesel reliance.

## **2. Innovation: The “Solar Survival Kit” Pilot (30%)**

Our innovation lies not just in **solar technology**, but in the **application and management model** — using solar as a form of *“crisis infrastructure.”*

### **What It Is**
A **modular, durable solar power system** designed for **public institutions** (e.g., community clinics, water pumping stations).

### **What Makes It Innovative**
1. **Co-Creation with Committees**  
   - Kits will be designed **in collaboration** with Popular Committees to meet local needs.
2. **Community-Led Ownership**  
   - Committees will oversee **deployment, maintenance, and management**.
3. **Replicable Blueprint**  
   - A pilot that can be scaled to other neighborhoods in Sudan.

**Key Difference:**  
We focus on **collective, public-service applications** of solar energy — moving away from fragmented, individual use.

## **3. Community Leadership and Participation (20%)**

The **Popular (Neighborhood-Based) Committees** — elected community representatives — will lead this project.

### **Their Role**
- **Raise Awareness:**  
  Use **WhatsApp infographics** and **short videos** to educate and dispel solar myths.
- **Plan & Decide:**  
  Lead **community meetings** to select installation sites and encourage contributions.
- **Coordinate & Implement:**  
  Work with us and partners to ensure smooth deployment and resolve local challenges.

This **“by the community, for the community”** approach follows an **Age, Gender, and Diversity (AGD)** framework, ensuring representation of all demographics.

## **4. Implementation Details: A 12-Month Roadmap (15%)**

We request **up to $45,000 USD** for a **12-month pilot**.

### **Timeline**
- **Months 1–2: Co-Design & Mobilization**  
  Community meetings, finalize kit design, and launch contribution campaign.
- **Months 3–6: Procurement & Installation**  
  Purchase and install solar kits in selected public institutions.
- **Months 7–9: Monitoring & Evaluation**  
  Track performance, collect feedback, and measure impact.
- **Months 10–12: Reporting & Dissemination**  
  Share findings with both **community** and **UNHCR**.

## **5. Impact, Sustainability, and Scale (20%)**

### **Impact**
- Reliable, affordable power for **critical public services**.
- Direct benefits to **hundreds of households**.
- Examples:  
  - **Clinic:** Uninterrupted healthcare services.  
  - **Water Pump:** Continuous access to clean water.

### **Sustainability**
- Committees trained for **management and maintenance**.
- Creation of a **community maintenance fund** (e.g., small user fee).

### **Scale**
- Pilot acts as a **replicable model** for other Sudanese neighborhoods.
- Potential for a **network of resilient, self-sufficient communities**.
