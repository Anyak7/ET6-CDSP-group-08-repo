# Data Exploration

## UN Comtrade data preparation script

### 1. **Input dataset**  

    File:../1_datasets/cleaned_data/UN_comtrade_clean_dataset.xlsx

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps

- Load the cleaned dataset from GitHub

- Display general dataset information and description

- Generate descriptive statistics for numeric columns:
  
   'Mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values'

- Identify potential outliers in relevant columns using simple statistical
   boxplot charts

- Analyze relationships between key variables

- Generate initial visualizations for selected conflict-affected countries
  (e.g., Sudan, Palestine, Ukraine) to highlight trade patterns and potential correlations.

### 3. Key Questions

- Do you have the right data?

The dataset contains relevant trade information; however, it is not
 comprehensive enough to address all aspects of our research questions.

- Do you need other data?

Yes, we require additional data on conflict events such as their dates,
intensity, and duration to provide a more complete analysis.

- Do you have the right question?
The research question is well-formulated, but to address it thoroughly, we need to collect additional data.
